    Lesson 1 Episode 3 --- Load committed versions in the working tree
    Please perform the following tasks individually

    Modify the file in the working tree at your pleasure recalling the
    versions in the history.
    The Git commands below may help you there (their order is just alphabetical)
        git diff HEAD~m Lines.txt
        git log --oneline
        git restore --sources HEAD~n Lines.txt
    where m and n are integers of your liking, including 0

    REQUIRED for the continuation (but not as a rule)
        1. NEVER STAGE OR COMMIT
        2. Make sure that you finish with a clean working tree at HEAD

    Formulate your own explanation of what you have observed
    The following questions are two sides of the same coin:
        What did you ask Git to do?
        What did Git do for you?
    Are there shortcuts to do the same with less typing?
