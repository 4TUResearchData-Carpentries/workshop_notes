## 2. Lesson notes

The material of each lesson will be presented in documents named as **Lesson[1234].\*** (the file extension may vary).
The documents are listed at the top of this web page, _above_ this text.
There, bring up the file of your interest upon clicking _exactly on the file name_, hence to the left in the line. 

### 2.1 Lesson 1 and 2: type-along notes

The commands the instructors type on the screen during each lesson will be appended continuously to the documents **Lesson[12].\*** (the file extension may vary).

Please use these lesson notes when you had to lag behind the instructor and need to catch up with the instructions. 

Please refresh the page with the lesson notes in your browser (typically, hit `F5`). 
So, you will view the latest commands as the notes grow.
Kindly notify the instructor if you do not see this happening.

After the end of the lessons the instructors will decorate the type-along notes with the division in Chapters and Episodes.

### 2.2 Lesson 3 and 4: Lecture notes

The lecture notes for these lessons can be found in:

- [Lecture notes lesson 3](Lesson3.md)
- [Lecture notes lesson 4](Lesson4.md)
